# Louis-Module-9-Node.js
## Description
I've been task with generating a README file generator using node.js. I have add code to index.js, generateMarkdown.js in the utils folder, and the gitignore.
Then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions when I am prompted for information about my application repository.
Then this is displayed as the title of the README when I enter my project title.
Then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests when I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions.
Then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under when I choose a license for my application from a list of options.
Then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile when I enter my GitHub username.
Then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions when I enter my email address.
Then I am taken to the corresponding section of the README when I click on the links in the Table of Contents.
Lastly I made sure to leave the code better than I found it.
